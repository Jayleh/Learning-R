Lesson 4
========================================================

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
data("diamonds")
summary(diamonds)
```
***

### Looking into the peak

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(aes(x = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9')) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 20000), breaks = seq(0, 20000, 2000))

p2 <- ggplot(aes(x = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25, color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9')) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 2000), breaks = seq(0, 2000, 250))

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 1)
```


```{r}
summary(diamonds$price)

subset(diamonds, price < 500)
subset(diamonds, price < 250)
nrow(subset(diamonds, price >= 15000))
```
***

### Histogram of diamond prices by cut

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9')) +
  facet_wrap(~cut)
```

***

### Price by cut questions:
Which cut has the highest priced diamond? Premium
Which cut has the lowest priced diamond? Premium, Ideal
Which cut has the lowest median price? Ideal

```{r}
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, summary)

tapply(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, max)
tapply(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, min)
tapply(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, median)
```

***

### Don't want y-axis to be fixed

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9')) +
  facet_wrap(~cut, scales = "free_y")
```

***

### Histograms of price per carat and facet it by cut

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = price/carat), data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = I('black'), fill = I('#FFA500')) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~cut, scales = "free_y")
```

***

### Investigate the price of diamonds using box plots,
numerical summaries, and one of the following categorical
variables: cut, clarity, or color.

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = color, y = price), data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 8000))
```

```{r}
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$color, summary)
```

What is the IQR for the best color? 3302.5
IQR for the worst?

```{r}
IQR(subset(diamonds, color == 'D')$price)
IQR(subset(diamonds, color == 'J')$price)
```

***
### Investigate the price per carat of diamonds across
the different colors of diamonds using boxplots.

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = color, y = price/carat, fill = color), data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 6500))
```

```{r}
by(diamonds$price/diamonds$carat, diamonds$color, summary)
```

Look what happens when we look at only the heavier (greater than median carat) diamonds with the best cut and best clarity. This is more what we would expect, as color gets worse price per carat decreases. The reason for this maybe because people are will to pay more for bigger diamond even if they have a bad cut, bad clarity and bad color. 
Agree?? Disagree?? 
Wow, over $15,000 per carat for a diamond with the best cut, clarity and color!

```{r}
uniform <- subset(diamonds, cut == "Ideal" & clarity == "IF" & carat > 0.7)
qplot(x = color, y = price/carat, data = uniform, geom = "boxplot", fill = color)
```

***

### Investigate the weight (carat) of the diamonds using a frequency polygon. Use
different binwidths to see how the frequency changes. 

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = carat), data = diamonds) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 2.5))
```

### What carat size has a count greater than 2000?

```{r}
table(diamonds$carat)
```

You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
ggsave() will save the last plot created.
For example...
                 qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
                 ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

Your task is to investigate the distribution of your friends'
birth months and days.

***

Here some questions you could answer, and we hope you think of others.

How many people share your birthday? Do you know them?
(Reserve time with them or save money to buy them a gift!)

Which month contains the most number of birthdays?

How many birthdays are in each month?

Which day of the year has the most number of birthdays?

Do you have at least 365 friends that have birthdays on everyday
of the year?

# **********************************************************************

You will need to do some data munging and additional research to
complete this task. This task won't be easy, and you may encounter some
unexpected challenges along the way. We hope you learn a lot from it though.

You can expect to spend 30 min or more on this task depending if you
use the provided data or obtain your personal data. We also encourage you
to use the lubridate package for working with dates. Read over the documentation
in RStudio and search for examples online if you need help.

You'll need to export your Facebooks friends' birthdays to a csv file.
You may need to create a calendar of your Facebook friends' birthdays
in a program like Outlook or Gmail and then export the calendar as a
csv file.

Once you load the data into R Studio, you can use the strptime() function
to extract the birth months and birth days. We recommend looking up the
documentation for the function and finding examples online.

We've included some links in the Instructor Notes to help get you started.

Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
    1. any questions you answered, your observations, and summary statistics
    2. snippets of code that created the plots
    3. links to the images of your plots


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
